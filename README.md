# river-nord-theme

A sample configuration and theme for [river](https://github.com/ifreund/river), a tiling window manager for wlroots based Wayland compositors written in [Zig](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/).

## Prerequisites

You must have the following software in order to make this work:

- Spotify (for added waybar spice)
- [playerctl](https://github.com/altdesktop/playerctl) (needed for playback stuff. Available usually in the official repositories)
- [river-tag-overlay](https://git.sr.ht/~leon_plickat/river-tag-overlay) (for showing pop-ups about the currently focused and occupied tags)
- [stacktile](https://git.sr.ht/~leon_plickat/stacktile) (more powerful layout generator for river)
- [ristate](https://gitlab.com/snakedye/ristate) (a river-status client)
- [waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar) (bar like polybar but for wayland)
- [mako](https://github.com/emersion/mako) (a notification daemon for wayland)
- [foot](https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot) (a native wayland terminal emulator)
- [wofi](https://hg.sr.ht/~scoopta/wofi) (rofi clone for wayland - unmaintained as of the moment but still going to use it)
- A nerd font like Hack Nerd Font
